# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application with a sign-in page. The application is styled with modern design principles and includes a custom font.

## Design and Features

### Sign-in Page

*   **Layout:** The sign-in page is centered vertically and horizontally.
*   **Header:** A header is displayed at the top of the page with the logo aligned to the left. The header has a background color of #2D6E75 at 12% opacity.
*   **Logo:** The logo text is "Codelab". It uses the "Unbounded" font from Google Fonts and has a hover effect that changes the color of the text.
*   **Form:** A sign-in form is displayed in the center of the page. The main content area has a large padding, a gap between elements, and a gradient background. The sign-in title container is a flex container with a fixed width and height, and its items are aligned to the start.
*   **Sign-in Title:** The sign-in title is stretched to fill the container, centered, and styled with the "Unbounded" font.

### Styling

*   **Global Styles:** The application uses global styles defined in `app/globals.css`.
*   **Font:** The "Unbounded" font is imported from Google Fonts and applied to the logo.
