# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application that provides a trade business with a platform to showcase their services, share blog posts, and manage user authentication. The application is built with a modern tech stack, including Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Firebase for backend services. The dashboard has been recently updated to a modern, single-page design for an improved user experience.

## Features

### Implemented Features:

*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality.
    *   Password reset functionality.
    *   Protected routes that require authentication.
*   **Blog:**
    *   Fetches blog posts from a Notion database.
    *   Displays a list of blog posts.
    *   Displays individual blog posts.
*   **Checkout:**
    *   A checkout page for users to purchase services.
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   A modern, single-page user dashboard built with TailwindCSS, accessible only to authenticated users.
    *   It consolidates various informational cards (Welcome, Analytics, Hours, Subscription, etc.) into a single, cohesive interface.

### Styling and Design:

*   The application utilizes a combination of **CSS modules** for component-level styling and **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling, as seen in the new dashboard.
*   The design is clean, modern, and responsive.

## Recent Refactoring: Modern Dashboard

The previous dashboard implementation, which was composed of multiple individual card components and styled with CSS modules, has been completely replaced with a more modern and streamlined solution.

### Steps Completed:

1.  **New Dashboard Creation:**
    *   A new, single-file dashboard component was created at `app/dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx`.
    *   This component now contains the entire layout and UI for the dashboard, using TailwindCSS for styling.

2.  **Component Consolidation:**
    *   The functionality and UI of all previous card components (`WelcomeCard`, `AnalyticsCard`, `HoursCounterCard`, etc.) were merged directly into the `NewDashboard.tsx` component.

3.  **Cleanup of Old Components:**
    *   All the old, individual card component files located in `app/dashboard/components/` were deleted.
    *   The associated CSS module file, `Cards.module.css`, was also removed.
    *   The original `app/dashboard/page.tsx` was updated to simply render the new `NewDashboard.tsx` component.

4.  **Code Quality and Linting:**
    *   A full linting pass was performed using `npm run lint -- --fix`.
    *   All reported issues were resolved, including:
        *   Removing unused component imports.
        *   Fixing an unescaped apostrophe in the JSX.
        *   Replacing a `require()` statement in `tailwind.config.ts` with the standard `import` syntax.

This refactoring effort has resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase and a more modern, user-friendly dashboard interface.
