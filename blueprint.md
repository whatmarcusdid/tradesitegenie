# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and components of the TradeSiteGenie application.

## Implemented Features

### Styling and Design

*   **Global Styles**: Basic global styles are defined in `app/globals.css`.
*   **Component-Specific Styles**: Individual components utilize CSS Modules for styling (e.g., `Footer.module.css`).
*   **Tailwind CSS**: The project is set up with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

### Components

*   **`Header`**: Located at `components/ui/Header.tsx`, this component provides the main navigation for the application. It displays different links based on the user's authentication status.
*   **`Footer`**: A simple footer component that displays a copyright notice.
*   **`Protected`**: A higher-order component used to protect routes that require authentication. It can also be configured to restrict access to admin users only.
*   **`Button`**: A reusable button component.

### Authentication

*   **Firebase Authentication**: The application uses Firebase for user authentication.
*   **Sign-in/Sign-up**: The application includes pages for user sign-in and sign-up, located at `app/signin/page.tsx` and `app/signup/page.tsx` respectively.
*   **Authentication State**: The `Header` component dynamically changes its content based on the user's authentication state.

### Routing

*   **`app/layout.tsx`**: The main layout file that includes the `Header` and `Footer` components.
*   **`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`**: A protected layout for the dashboard section of the application.
*   **`app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page.
*   **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: The main dashboard page.
*   **`app/reports/page.tsx`**: A page for displaying reports.
*   **`app/scheduling/page.tsx`**: A page for scheduling.
*   **`app/signin/page.tsx`**: The user sign-in page.
*   **`app/signup/page.tsx`**: The user sign-up page.
*   **`app/tickets/new/page.tsx`**: A page for creating new maintenance tickets.

## Current Plan

*   **Analyze the codebase:** I will analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation of the scheduling feature.
*   **Identify areas for improvement:** I will identify areas where the scheduling feature can be improved, such as adding more advanced booking options, improving the user interface, and adding more robust error handling.
*   **Implement the improvements:** I will implement the identified improvements to the scheduling feature.
